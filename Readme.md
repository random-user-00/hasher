# Hasher - File hash generator written in Python
### Features
- Can calculate file hash for different algorithms at once.
- Memory/IO efficient. It reads fie only once even when calculating hash for multiple algorithms.
- No other dependencies other than Python standard library.
- Supported algorithms. Supported algorithms depends on your Python version and OS.  
  To get the list of supported algorithms run `calc_hash.py -h`.

### Limitations
- All symbolic links will be ignored, support will be added in future.

### Command line usage
#### Linux
